# H2 Database Configuration Fixes

## Latest Fix: Incompatible H2 Parameters

### Issue
The application was failing to start with the following error:
```
Caused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLFeatureNotSupportedException: Feature not supported: "AUTO_SERVER=TRUE && DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE" [50100-224]
```

This error indicates that using both `AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` and `DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE` together is not supported in H2 version 2.2.224.

### Solution
The solution was to remove the `DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE` parameter from the database URL, keeping only `AUTO_SERVER=TRUE`:

```properties
# Modified database URL
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:./data/feedbackdb_new;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE
```

The existing Hibernate properties that were previously added to prevent the database connection from being closed prematurely during shutdown should still provide that functionality, even without the `DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE` parameter.

## Previous Fix: Database Connection Closing Prematurely

### Issue
The application was encountering a database connection error with the following stack trace:
```
org.h2.engine.Engine.openSession(Engine.java:222) ~[h2-2.2.224.jar:2.2.224]
at org.h2.engine.Engine.createSession(Engine.java:201) ~[h2-2.2.224.jar:2.2.224]

at org.h2.Driver.connect(Driver.java:59) ~[h2-2.2.224.jar:2.2.224]
...
```

The error was occurring because the database connection was being closed prematurely during application shutdown.

### Solution
The solution was to add several Hibernate properties to prevent the database connection from being closed during shutdown:

```properties
# Prevent Hibernate from closing the database connection during shutdown
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.handling_mode=DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_HOLD
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.release_mode=AFTER_TRANSACTION
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=none
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.schema_management_tool=none
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.schema_action=none
```

These properties work together to:
1. Delay acquiring database connections until they're needed and hold onto them until the session is closed (`connection.handling_mode=DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_HOLD`)
2. Release database connections only after a transaction is completed, rather than after each statement (`connection.release_mode=AFTER_TRANSACTION`)
3. Disable Hibernate's schema validation and generation during startup and shutdown (`hbm2ddl.auto=none`, `hbm2ddl.schema_management_tool=none`, `hbm2ddl.schema_action=none`)
